## 📚 What I Learned

Through building this game, I strengthened my skills in:

- ✅ **JavaScript Variables & Functions** — Proper data management
- ✅ **DOM Manipulation** — Dynamic UI updates based on game state
- ✅ **Event Listeners** — Capturing and responding to user clicks
- ✅ **Game Logic** — Implementing win/lose/draw conditions
- ✅ **Flow Control** — Managing game rounds and scoring
- ✅ **Random Generation** — Creating unpredictable computer moves

## 💡 Key Implementation

### Game Flow
1. User selects their move
2. Computer randomly generates its move
3. Compare both moves using game logic
4. Display result and update score
5. Allow quick replay

### Core Logic
```javascript
// Example game logic structure
function determineWinner(userChoice, computerChoice) {
    // Compare choices and return result
}
```
